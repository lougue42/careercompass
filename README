## ðŸ§© About the Project
Career Compass began as a personal tool for managing my own job search during senior year.  
It quickly became a hands-on way to apply everything I learned while earning my **Full Stack Software Developer certification**.  
Built with care, iteration, and the help of an occasional LLM or two.
